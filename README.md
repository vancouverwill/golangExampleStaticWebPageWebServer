# golangExampleStaticWebPageWebServer

setup with `go install` and then `go build`

The program should then be run with just `./staticWebPageWebServer`

## background

very simple static website to show how straightforward this would be with Go and as a place for me to play with the http, httptest libraries with Travis.
